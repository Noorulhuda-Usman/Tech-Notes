# 📌 Software Testing Basics  

## ❓ Why is Testing Required?  
- To **identify defects** in the development phase.  
- To **ensure quality** of the product.  
- To **save money**, as defects found early cost less to fix.  
- To **build customer confidence** and improve business.

## ❓ What is Software Testing?  
**Software Testing (ST)** is a method to verify whether the actual software product matches the expected requirements and ensures that it is **defect-free**.  

---

## ❓ What is Manual Testing?  
Manual testing is a process where the **tester manually executes test cases** without using automation tools. It ensures that all application features work correctly.  

- The tester prepares a **Test Plan Document** to guide the process.  
- Any new application **must be manually tested** before automation testing is introduced.

## 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases  

The **SDLC** consists of **six** phases:  

### 1️⃣ Requirement or Initial Phase  
📌 **Planning** (Done by **Business Analyst**)  
📜 Key Documents:  
- **FRS** (Functional Requirement Specification)  
- **BRS** (Business Requirement Specification)  
- **CRS** (Client Requirement Specification)  
- **BDD** (Business Design Document)  

### 2️⃣ Analysis Phase  
📌 **Analysis** (Done by **System Analyst, Project Manager**)  

### 3️⃣ Designing Phase  
📌 **Designing** (Done by **Chief Architecture Engineer, Team Lead**)  

### 4️⃣ Coding Phase  
📌 **Implementation & Deployment** (Done by **Developers, Programmers**)  

### 5️⃣ Testing Phase  
📌 **Testing & Integration** (Done by **Test Engineers**)  

### 6️⃣ Delivery & Maintenance Phase  
📌 **Maintenance** (Done by **Support Engineers**)

## 🔍 **Types of Software Testing**  

### 1️⃣ **Manual Testing**  
- Test cases are executed **manually** without automation tools.  
- Ensures correct functionality before automation testing is implemented.  

### 2️⃣ **Automation Testing**  
- Uses **testing tools** (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, TestNG) to execute test cases.  
- Saves time and reduces human effort.

## 🔄 **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) Phases**  

The **STLC** consists of the following phases:  

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Understand testing needs from project documentation.  
2. **Test Planning** – Define testing scope, resources, and schedule.  
3. **Test Case Design** – Create test cases & test scripts.  
4. **Test Environment Setup** – Configure software/hardware for testing.  
5. **Test Execution** – Run test cases and record results.  
6. **Test Closure** – Evaluate test reports and finalize the testing phase.

## 🏗 **Levels of Testing**  

1️⃣ **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components (done by developers).  
2️⃣ **Integration Testing** – Ensures modules work together.  
3️⃣ **System Testing** – Verifies the entire application as a whole.  
4️⃣ **Acceptance Testing** – Ensures the system meets business requirements.

## 🔬 **Types of Testing**  

### **Functional Testing** (Validates software functionality)  
✔️ Unit Testing  
✔️ Integration Testing  
✔️ System Testing  
✔️ Acceptance Testing  
✔️ Regression Testing  
✔️ Smoke & Sanity Testing  

### **Non-Functional Testing** (Checks performance & reliability)  
⚡ Performance Testing  
🔒 Security Testing  
📱 Usability Testing  
📊 Load & Stress Testing

## 🛠 **Common Testing Terms**  

🔹 **Bug** – An error in the software.  
🔹 **Defect** – A flaw in functionality found during testing.  
🔹 **Test Case** – A set of inputs and expected outputs for testing.  
🔹 **Test Plan** – A document outlining the testing strategy.  
🔹 **Regression Testing** – Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality.

## ✅ **Conclusion**  
Software testing plays a **critical role in software development** by ensuring quality, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction. It involves **manual and automated testing methods** and follows a structured **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** to ensure all aspects of the application are verified before release.
