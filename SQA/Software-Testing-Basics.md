## ❓ Why is Testing Required?  
- To **identify defects** in the development phase.  
- To **ensure quality** of the product.  
- To **save money**, as defects found early cost less to fix.  
- To **build customer confidence** and improve business.

Manual testing is a process where the **tester manually executes test cases** without using automation tools. It ensures that all application features work correctly.  

- The tester prepares a **Test Plan Document** to guide the process.
